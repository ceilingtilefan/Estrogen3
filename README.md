# Estrogen
This is a fork and parody of [flameaway/RemoveConfidential](https://github.com/flameaway/RemoveConfidential/). Nothing substantial is owned by me.

## Usage
This repository is meant to be used as an alternative to building with a computer. If you want to build this tweak for yourself, fork the repository and enable workflows in your forks 'Actions' tab. Change 'meow i love femboys :3' to a custom text of yours inside of `Tweak.x`, and commit the changes. Assuming Theos actually installs, a release will be made with your custom text.

Legal text is separate from footnote text, meaning you can have both a footnote and legal text. You do not need Serotonin to use this; it works for palera1n and should work for Dopamine too.

### Disclaimer
The preferences do not work and are purely cosmetic. You can remove the subproject if you are not comfortable with it. This tweak is for rootless only, though can be built for both rootful and roothide with very little effort put in.

## Building
Refer to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/flameaway/RemoveConfidential.git) for building, as this repository only serves the purpose of building without a computer.
